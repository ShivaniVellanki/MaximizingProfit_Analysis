# MaximizingProfit_Analysis
The project uses linear programming to optimize product distribution for a hardware company, aiming to maximize profits within specific budget and space constraints. Adjustments in selling prices, budget, and warehouse space are analyzed for their impact on net profits, suggesting expansion for maximal gain.

The project focuses on maximizing the net profit for a northern hardware company planning to lease a warehouse for supplying goods to regional retailers. Through a linear programming model that considers selling prices, costs, and constraints like budget, storage space, and inventory requirements, the analysis aims to optimize the monthly distribution of four different products. The goal is to identify the best combination of product quantities that maximizes profit while adhering to a set monthly budget of $170,000 and a warehouse space limit of 12,300 square feet.

Utilizing solver tools and sensitivity analysis, the project explores various scenarios, including adjustments in selling prices, monthly budgets, and warehouse space, to understand their impact on net profits. The results indicate that with the original budget and space constraints, the maximum achievable profit is $142,050.703. However, increasing the budget to $193,228.5 could raise profits to $155,004.03, and expanding the warehouse space could further boost profits to $165,400.81. The analysis recommends expanding the warehouse to achieve the highest profit, demonstrating the practical implications of linear programming in business decision-making.
